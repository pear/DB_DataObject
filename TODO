Development of DB_DataObject_NG (Next Generation DataObject)..

To assist in the development of addtional features for the growth of DB_DataObject, 
the plan is to develop an extended version DB_DataObject_NG, which extends the current
version and adds alot of the more experiemental features as listed below..

Features from the NG version can then be carefully moved back into the core DataObject.




Current TODO list:
----------------------------------
    Issue: float support..
	Add type support for floats, testing and casting etc..
	
	
    Issue: ini structure is big when using many tables.
	
	Intend to move the structure to to footer of the class file.
	where it sets the $GLOBALS[_DB_DATAOBJECT][ini][{databasename}]....
	

    	



    Issue: More detailed cached table information

        make available an extra ini file database.details.ini, which contains
        [table__sizes]
        column = size
        
	** initially to enable testing of field lenghts etc..
	** secondarily to enable database creation...!!
	
	
	
	 

    Issue: Table Rebuilds
        
        ** not really practicall - running with on-the-fly querying should solve this for the most part..
        
        
     
    Issue: Replace 

        Mysql has a nice replace feature, It would be nice to have in dataObjects
        
        Solution:
        Add a method, if the database is mysql, use the native 'REPLACE call'
        otherwise, do a select on ID then insert|update..
	
	Maybe???  - bloated api already????

    
    
    Issue: Simplify the connection configuration.
        
        Current suggestion is to replace 
            database = dsn
        with 
            default_database = dsn
        and treat default more like a database name
	
	

    Issue: adding more realms to configuration
        
        Proposal here is to add realms for database dsn's, table mappings etc. along
        with hard coding the location of database cache files...
        
	mostly fixed with
	{project}_database = dsn
	{project}_ini      = /location/.....
	
	need to add {project}/dataobject to factory...
        
        
     
        
        
    Issue: Persistant Storage..
    
        At present DB_DataObject, caches results to get queries, within the same page, this can be 
        expected to work 'most of the time', as most of the time concurrent updates are not that frequent.
        however, it is expected that the object may be used in a situation where this may affect it.
        
        As well as this, there may be times where it is preferable to have persistant storage over a number
        of page calls..
        
        The plan here is to implement a configuation option, that defaults to no caching, and can be set
        to either 
        a) do caching withing a single page request (as per current)
        b) do full caching with manual clearing... 
        c) do no caching.....
        
        along with this expanding the quantity of data being cached may be considered.
        
        either this, or a method, that specifically tags something as cachable.......
        
        
  
    Issue: $__DB->dsn["database'] does not work with oracle.
        
        Need to work around this somehow... ???
        
    Issue :Generator does not work with oracle..
        
        Looks like it is using the wrong data from the Oracle getTableInfo call...
        
    Issue: use isset rather than @
        
        as it tokenizes down to one opcode, and is 'better practice..'
        
    Issue: dependant deletes.. / updates./ inserts
        
        Links.ini (or the future XML alternative?) could provide details on
        foreign keys - and force the deletion of data that is dependant on 
        one item..
        (updates & inserts could also do checks..)
