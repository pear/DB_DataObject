Current TODO list:
----------------------------------
Issue: Table Rebuilds

If you modify the database table, then DB_DataObject will be unaware of the change until you
run createTables.php again.


Solution:
if the 'production' option is off, then it should rebuild the table information at the same time as loading
the table description. and compare the current definition to the new generated one...

-----------------------------------
Issue: More detailed cached table information

make available an extra ini file database.details.ini, which contains
[table]
column = type:size:notnull: etc. 
from the tableInfo() call

to allow quick lookup/retrieval of this data for any purpose...


-----------------------------------
Issue: Replace 

Mysql has a nice replace feature, It would be nice to have in dataObjects

Solution:
Add a method, if the database is mysql, use the native 'REPLACE call'
otherwise, do a select on ID then insert|update..

----------------------------------
Issue: Delete -- DONE 0.7

delete can be called in many ways:

$object->get(12);
$object->delete();
in which case deleting on the primary key is desired.

$object->colour = 'red';
$object->delete();
in which case deleting on the _build_condition is desired
(eg. when the primary key is not set)

$object->whereAdd("colour like 'r%');
$object->delete(TRUE);
works OK - just uses the where condition, not the values.
